// The deque is a double-ended queue. It is similar to a vector but has efficient insertion and deletion at both the beginning and the end. It is a sequence container that, like a vector, supports random access to elements. The deque is a generalization of the vector, and it is a sequence container that supports random access to elements, constant time insertion and deletion at the beginning or end, and linear time insertion and deletion in the middle.
